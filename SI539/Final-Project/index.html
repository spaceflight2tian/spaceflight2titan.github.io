          <h3>Checkboxes</h3>
          <h4>The site I choose to perform an accessibility evaluation is <a href="http://alumnus.alumni.umich.edu/notable-alumni/">http://alumnus.alumni.umich.edu/notable-alumni/</a>. I use the checklist from voxmedia and pick the QA role. There are no images(decorative or not), so the last two categories can not be evaluated due to this reason. </h4>
          <p>No：Run through each page with the WAVE Chrome Extension.</p>
          <p>No：Users should be able to navigate through content using their keyboard.</p>
          <p>No：The general architecture and hierarchy of the content should make sense.</p>
          <p>N/A：Charts and images should all have alt-text so that users with screen readers or users on a slow connection will still be able to understand the images.</p>
          <p>N/A：Decorative images should not be visible to screen readers.</p>

          <h4>Recommendation 1</h4>
          <p>There are 10 Errors on the page by checking WAVE. Four of them are "A heading contains no content." in the footer area above texts and links. Add header content to those headings if there is conternt there, or delet the heading tags. </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Recommendation 2</h4>
          <p>The links have no text for the Social Media section. Remove the empty link or provide text within the link that describes the functionality and/or target of that link. Or provdie alt information for the social media icons. </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Recommendation 3</h4>
          <p>Users can navigate most content using a screen reader. However the plus button for each category of notable alumni cannot be read, so people cannot know the existence of the dropdown content. Enable the screen reader to recognize the plus signs, so people who need to read screen by using screen reader can access to those contents. </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Recommendation 4</h4>
          <p>Users can not access to plus signs for each category of notable alumni by using their keyboards. Provide accessing to drop down menus, so users will not get trapped in any buttons and gain access to the content in the dropdown sections. </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h4>Recommendation 5</h4>
          <p>The font size should be larger, so users can view the content from a few feet away.</p>
